# Cloud Practitioner

# Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

* Trade capital expense for variable expense
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Stop guessing capacity
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
* Go global in minutes

# Global Infrastructure

* AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
* An AWS Region is a physical location in the world. Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon Regions.
* AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones.
* Availability Zone consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
* Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency links.

# Amazon EC2 instance types

## General purpose instances provide a **balance** of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:

* web servers
* application servers
* gaming servers
* backend servers for enterprise applications
* small and medium databases

## Compute optimized instances are ideal for **compute-bound applications** that benefit from **high-performance processors**.

* Batch processing workloads
* High performance web/app/gaming servers

## Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process **large datasets in memory**. 

* High-performance database (redis)
* Workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data.

## Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators

* Floating-point number calculations
* Graphics processing
* Data pattern matching.

## Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require **high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage**. High IOPS requirement.

* Distributed file systems
* Data warehousing applications
* High-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
